# EveryDollar Chrome Extensions
**WARNING: This plugin is not supported or endorsed by EveryDollar or Ramsey Solutions in any way.  This plugin has no warranty.  Use at your own risk.**

The purpose of this chrome extension is to help you ensure that you have enough cash in your bank account to fulfil your budget needs. It will calculate the total amount of money required to satisfy your current budget and compare it against a given account.

If you divide your bank account into funds and have all of those funds represented within EveryDollar as funds, then the expectation is that once all transactions have cleared and everydollar has fetched your current bank balance, the "Balance Difference" will be 0.

A refresh button is added to the EveryDollar side nav.

You must define an account name to compare against in the extension pop-up configuration. You can configure the plugin to exclude certain categories by providing a Comma separated list of Categories to exclude in the extension pop-up configuration.
